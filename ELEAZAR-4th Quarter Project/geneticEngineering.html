			<p>Genetic engineering, also known as genetic modification, is the technique of removing, modifying, or adding genes to a DNA molecule to change the information it contains. </p> 
			<p>Genetic engineering involves changing a single base pair (A-T or C-G), deleting a region of DNA, or adding a new segment of DNA.</p>
			<p>By changing the information of the DNA molecule, genetic engineering enables the creation of new substances or new functions for it changes the type or amount of proteins an organism is capable of producing. </p>
			<p>For example, genetic engineering involves adding a gene from one species to an organism from a different species to produce a desired trait. </p>
			<p>Genetic engineering is used in research and industry. Genetic engineering has been applied to the production of cancer therapies, brewing yeasts, genetically modified plants and livestock, and more.</p>
