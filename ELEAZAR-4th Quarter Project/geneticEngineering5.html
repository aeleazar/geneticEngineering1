			<h3 id="intro">Despite its many benefits, Genetic Engineering also comes with many issues such as but not limited to: </h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Humans Playing As God -- Since human beings are not omniscient, omnipotent, or all good, they should not assume the risk-laden responsibility that is inextricably tied up with many forms of genetic engineering.</li>
				<li>Patients Being A Contentious Issue -- Contentious, as defined by Merriam Webster, is a being that is prone to cause disagreement or argument.</li> 
				<li>Introduction Of Dangerous Traits Into Microorganisms That Were Previously Free Of Them</li>
				<li>As of the moment, regulations on Genetic Engineering are lacking, and thus, there is nothing saying right now to how far humans can go to playing as God.</li>
